- 👋 Hi, I’m Erfan(Err-fon), 19 years old, and am currently attending the Tech Academy as a student learning their software developer bootcamp full-time remotely.
- 👀 I’m interested in landing a job in the tech field as an entry-level engineer near or around my graduation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the software developer bootcamp from Tech Academy which covers many popular programming languages and frameworks. Not only do I get to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C#, the .NET framework, but I also get two different two-week projects with my fellow classmates to show to employers that I have some experience working with teams and being able to solve problems independently.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many projects in the future with many diffent wonderful people so that I can learn more and get to know some amazing people at the same time.
- 📫 You can reach me at my email: erfanbro46@gmail.com.
